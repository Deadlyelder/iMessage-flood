# iMessage-flood
A simple script that floods the iMessage conversation with emojis ;) Created for fun.

## Note
The scripts not longer work. If time permits, will try to repair them.

## Requirements

* macOS that has `iMessage.app` with a working iMessage account
* [JSON Helper](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-helper/) or from [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/json-helper-for-applescript/id453114608?mt=12)

## Use

1. Edit the `flood.scpt` and insert your iMessage account and that of the target.
2. Run the script using the AppleScript Editor.
3. Have fun

## Modify

* You can modify the program easily by replacing the `floodAPI` in the program to point towards your herokuapp hosted
emoji. For example on how to have such server, check the url in the program.

## Issue

* For some reason it doesnt work with the macOS Sierra which I presume might be due to Apple restricting the scripting
capabilities of `Messages.app`
